// Builds the website and copies its `dist/` output into `tauri/webroot/`, which
// the desktop shell serves from a private scheme (`shell/src/webroot.rs`). This
// is what makes the app self-contained: the game runs entirely on-device,
// offline, and updates only when a new build ships.
//
// The website build is a `vite build` with the default base `/`, which is
// exactly what a single-origin shell wants — the service worker it emits is
// still in the bundle, and the page leaves it unregistered on its own once it
// sees the shell's global (`pwa/src/shell-host.ts`). It is built with
// VITE_SHELL_BUILD=on, which leaves every link back to the source and the
// website out of it (pwa/vite.config.ts), and a dist/ that still names them is
// refused before it is copied (scripts/lib/no-source.mjs).
//
// `--skip-build` copies whatever the last build left in `pwa/dist/`, for
// iterating on the shell without paying for the site each time. Every release
// path builds.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/bundle-web.mjs                # build the site, then copy
//   node scripts/bundle-web.mjs --skip-build   # re-copy an existing dist/
