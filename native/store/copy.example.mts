// THE STORE COPY'S SHAPE — a committed skeleton, not a listing.
//
// The real words live in `copy.mts` beside this, which is GITIGNORED: the game
// is paid on the App Store and open source on GitHub, and the listing's copy is
// the one thing those two facts pull apart. `listing.mts` explains the split.
//
// THIS FILE IS DELIBERATELY NOT WRITING. Every string below is a placeholder
// naming what belongs there, short enough that nobody could mistake it for
// marketing and long enough to satisfy the field limits so a fresh clone
// typechecks and `make store-metadata` runs end to end. Do not improve the
// prose here — improving it would recreate exactly what the split exists to
// avoid, one adjective at a time.
//
// THREE STOREFRONTS ARE DESCRIBED FROM THIS ONE FILE — the App Store's phone
// listing, the MAC App Store's, and Steam's. One authored source because they
// describe one game; three sets of words because a phone, a Mac and a Steam
// page are three different readers.
//
// HOW TO WRITE THE REAL THING: load the `store-listing` skill. It carries the
// craft — what each field is for, every limit and which of them truncate
// silently, how the keyword budget is actually spent, the guideline 4.2
// argument the review notes have to make, and the traps. The knowledge is in
// the repository; the words are not.
//
//   cp native/store/copy.example.mts native/store/copy.mts
//   # …then follow the skill, and keep a backup outside this checkout.
