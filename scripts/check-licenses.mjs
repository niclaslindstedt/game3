// SPDX-License-Identifier: PolyForm-Noncommercial-1.0.0
// THE DEPENDENCY LICENCE CHECK — every npm package any of this repository's
// three trees installs (the root and its workspace, the phone app under
// native/, the desktop packager under tauri/) carries a licence on the
// allow-list below, read straight out of the committed lockfiles.
//
// The lockfile is the source rather than node_modules: it records each
// package's `license` field at install time, it is what CI installs from, and
// reading it needs no install — so the check runs in a second and answers for
// exactly the tree that ships. A package whose licence is missing, or not on
// the list, fails the run by name; widening the list is a decision a pull
// request has to argue for, which is the point of keeping it here in one
// place.
//
// An SPDX expression is read the way its licence reads: `A OR B` is fine when
// either is allowed (the choice is ours), `A AND B` only when both are.
//
// Usage:
//   make check-licenses
//   node scripts/check-licenses.mjs [--verbose]
