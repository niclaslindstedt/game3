// SENDING A PICTURE SOMEWHERE ELSE — the three ways a screenshot can leave
// the game, and an honest answer about which of them this device has.
//
// There is no single "share" on the web, so this module answers the
// question the gallery actually has — what can this browser do with a PNG?
// — and gives each answer its own verb. The gallery offers the ones that
// come back true, in this order, because that is the order of how directly
// each gets the picture to a person:
//
//   SHARE   `navigator.share({ files })`, the platform's own sheet. On a
//           phone this is the whole point: the camera roll, Messages, and
//           whatever chat app the player actually uses. Desktop Safari and
//           Windows Chrome raise a real sheet too, which is why this is
//           never gated on "is this touch" — it is gated on `canShare`, and
//           the browser is the one that knows.
//   COPY    the clipboard, as an image/png item. Where there is no sheet
//           there is nearly always a paste target one window away.
//   SAVE    a download. The floor: every browser can put a file on a disk.
//
// EVERY PROBE IS A REAL PROBE. `navigator.share` exists in browsers that
// will refuse a file payload, and `navigator.clipboard.write` exists in
// browsers with no PNG writer, so both are asked about the exact thing
// being sent rather than about their own existence. A button offered on a
// false positive is a button that does nothing when pressed, which is worse
// than one that was never there.
//
// SHARING NEEDS THE GESTURE. Both `share` and `write` want transient user
// activation, so they have to be called from the press itself and never
// after an `await` that outlives it. That is why nothing here decodes,
// re-encodes or fetches: a caller hands over a Blob it already holds.
//
// Which the gallery can always manage: it presses with the PNG already on
// the roll. The SHUTTER cannot — its picture does not exist yet at the
// moment of the press, because the drawing buffer can only be read inside
// the animation callback that filled it, frames away (game/screenshots.ts)
// — so the shutter files the picture and says so, and sending it on is one
// row of the front door away.
