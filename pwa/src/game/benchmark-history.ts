// EVERY RUN THIS MACHINE HAS SCORED — kept, so a score can be compared with
// the one before it instead of with somebody's memory of it.
//
// The benchmark is a comparison instrument and nothing else (`benchmark.ts`):
// the number means nothing on its own, and everything against a second
// number taken on the same machine with one row of OPTIONS ▸ VIDEO moved.
// Run it, walk to the options, move DISTANCE, run it again — and by then the
// first card is gone, which left the whole method resting on somebody having
// written the number down or screenshotted it. So every finished run is kept
// here, and the difference between two settings is a thing you can read off
// a list rather than a thing you have to have planned for.
//
// IT KEEPS THE WHOLE RUN, not the score. A score alone would make the list a
// scoreboard, and what is wanted is the run back: the graph redrawn, the sag
// found at the frame it happened on, the debug report copied out weeks after
// the machine that drew it was warm. The readings are what all three are made
// of, so the readings are what is stored.
//
// It is per MACHINE and cannot be anything else — a phone and a desktop are a
// factor of ten apart on exactly this work — so it lives in local storage
// beside the rider's own settings.
//
// THE PICTURES ARE THE EXCEPTION IT FOLLOWS RATHER THAN BREAKS: the shot roll
// is in IndexedDB because a PNG is hundreds of kilobytes (`shot-store.ts`).
// A run is a few tens of kilobytes of numbers, which is what localStorage is
// for, and losing the history to a full store is a comparison somebody has to
// take again rather than a picture that is gone.
//
// THE POLICY IS STORAGE-FREE and the skin over `localStorage` is three
// functions at the bottom — `records.ts`'s split, for `records.ts`'s reason:
// the root suite runs on plain Node with no DOM in it, and what actually
// needs holding here is the FORMAT. `mergeBenchmarks` is where a stored blob
// becomes runs, and `keptWith` is the cap; both are pure, and both are what
// `tests/benchmark_test.ts` reads.
