// THE INDEX — the benchmark's time, turned into a number that compares —
// and the two lines the card draws it as.
//
// The run itself is a fixed piece of riding and a stopwatch (`benchmark.ts`):
// thirty seconds of a scripted race, drawn as fast as the machine will draw
// it, and the answer is how long that took. That is the honest measurement
// and it is a poor SCORE, for the reason every stopwatch is: lower is
// better, the interesting machines are all bunched into the low numbers,
// and nobody can say what twice as fast looks like without doing division
// in their head.
//
// So the time is reported as an index instead, and the point it is pinned
// at is the one point on the scale that means something on its own:
//
//   INDEX 100 IS REAL TIME — the machine draws the race in the time it
//   would take to ride it. 200 is twice that, 400 four times, 50 half.
//
// Which makes it a ratio and not a unit: it is the same number whatever the
// run's length is changed to, higher is better the way a score should be,
// and two of them divide into each other to give the thing anybody actually
// wants to know — this machine is 2.4× that one.
//
// AND IT IS READ WHILE IT RUNS. The same division answers over fifteen
// frames as over eighteen hundred, so the run draws its own score as it
// goes. What is plotted is the score OF THE RUN SO FAR — every frame since
// the green over all the time since the green — rather than the score of
// the last fifteen frames on their own. A window that narrow is mostly
// noise (one compile, one page fault, one other program waking up), and a
// graph of it is a hedge nobody reads; the running answer starts wherever
// the first fifteen frames landed and walks steadily onto the final number,
// which is the LAST point on the line and not a separate calculation.
//
// THE SECOND LINE IS THE OPPOSITE READING, and it is there because the
// first one HIDES things by construction. A running average is a memory: by
// the end of a run it is eighteen hundred frames deep, and a stretch that
// halves the frame rate moves it by a few points and never says where. So
// beside it goes the SNAPSHOT — the rate the one frame at that reading was
// drawn at, remembering nothing, deliberately unsmoothed. Whatever the
// machine did at second nineteen is at second nineteen on that line, at its
// full depth, and the average is then visibly the thing it drags down.
//
// THE TWO LINES SHARE A BOX, because they are one quantity in two units. An
// index IS a frame rate: `INDEX_REAL · step` per frame a second, so at the
// shipped sixtieth 100 index is 60 fps and neither line needs a scale of
// its own. What the second axis on the right buys is not a second geometry
// but a second LABEL — the same ceiling read in the unit people actually
// think in — and, because the two lines are then directly comparable, the
// one reading that matters: where the snapshot sits against the average is
// whether the score is still being earned or is being paid off.
//
// DOM-free, so `tests/benchmark_test.ts` holds the whole model.
