// THE BENCHMARK'S REPORT — a run written down, in text somebody can paste.
//
// The card shows a score and two lines, which is what a rider needs to know
// whether their machine is coping. This is the other audience: whoever is
// going to make the game faster, who needs to know WHAT THE FRAME WAS DOING
// rather than how fast it went. A number without its conditions cannot be
// acted on, and a number without a breakdown cannot be acted on WELL — "it
// is slow" and "it is submitting nine hundred draw calls, four hundred of
// them cover" are different bug reports.
//
// So the report carries three things, in the order somebody reads them:
//
//   THE CONDITIONS — the shore, the field, the buffer, and every row of
//   OPTIONS ▸ VIDEO. Without these two runs cannot be compared at all, and
//   the whole use of the tool is comparing two runs.
//
//   THE RUN — every reading: how far in, the score so far, the rate of that
//   frame, and what that frame cost the renderer. This is where a thermal
//   sag is told from a scene that got heavier, because the draw calls are
//   sitting in the same table as the frame rate — and where THE WATER'S OWN
//   CPU TIME is, which is the one line in this game that a draw call cannot
//   stand in for: the near grid calls the engine's `surfaceAt` thousands of
//   times a frame and none of that is the GPU's.
//
//   THE SCENE — what was actually standing there on the last frame, by
//   subsystem. This is the part that says where to look.
//
// `FrameCost` IS STATED HERE rather than in `renderer.ts` for one reason:
// this module, the history and the sheet are DOM-free and the tests read
// them, and a type imported from the renderer would drag three.js into a
// suite that runs on plain Node. The renderer imports it from here and
// re-exports it, so there is still one name for one thing.
