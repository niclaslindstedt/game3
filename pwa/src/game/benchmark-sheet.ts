// THE SCORE SHEET — every run this machine has kept, on one line each, in
// text somebody can paste.
//
// The debug report (`benchmark-report.ts`) is ONE run in full: its conditions,
// its hundred and twenty readings, the scene behind them. This is the other
// half of the same idea — every run against every other one, which is the
// question the benchmark actually exists to answer. Nobody wants to know what
// their machine scores; they want to know what SEE-THROUGH costs on it, and
// that is a difference between two lines rather than anything on either.
//
// WHICH IS WHY THE SETTINGS ARE ON THE LINE. A table of scores with the
// conditions somewhere else is a table that cannot be read: the eye has to
// hold a number while it goes and looks up what produced it, and by the third
// run it has stopped. So each run carries OPTIONS ▸ VIDEO as it stood, beside
// its own score, and two lines are then a comparison at a glance.
//
// AND WHY THEY ARE GLYPHS. Spelled out, the six rows are `MEDIUM · HIGH ·
// MEDIUM · MEDIUM · ON · MAX` — fifty characters that push the score off the
// left of any column and wrap the moment the sheet is pasted anywhere narrow.
// As a rung on a ladder each row is ONE character, the six fit in the width of
// a word, and the shape of a line is legible before any of it is read: `██████`
// is everything up, `▁▁▁▁▁▁` everything down, and the run that moved one row is
// the line with one glyph out of place.
//
// The ladder is `▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█` — a bar that grows with what the row costs, so
// cheapest is lowest and there is nothing to memorise. It is TEXT, which is
// the whole point: it survives a copy into a chat window, a commit message or
// a review comment, where a colour does not. On screen the same code is
// tinted as well (`menu-bench.tsx`), because a screen can afford both — but
// nothing is said in the colour that the glyph does not already say.
//
// THE LEGEND IS AT THE BOTTOM, and it is generated from the ladders the sheet
// actually used rather than written out here. A legend restating the stops
// would be a second copy of them and would go stale the first time a row
// gained a rung — so both the code and the legend read `PICTURE_LADDERS`,
// which sits beside `pictureRows` in `picture-rows.ts` precisely so that a row
// added to the picture is added to the thing that decodes it in the same
// breath.
//
// DOM-free: numbers and records in, a string out.
