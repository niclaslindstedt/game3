# Updating the LLM prompts

**Governing spec sections:** §13.5 (LLM prompts — versioned
`prompts/<name>/<major>_<minor>_<patch>.md` files with required YAML front
matter), §21.5 (this skill is mandated because `prompts/` is a drift-prone
artifact whenever a project ships LLM-driven behaviour).

Every LLM-driven step is defined by a versioned prompt under
`prompts/<name>/<major>_<minor>_<patch>.md` with a required YAML front matter
block (`name`, `description`, `version` matching the filename) and
`## System` / `## User` sections — see §13.2 of `OSS_GAME_SPEC.md` and
`prompts/README.md`. Prompt files are **immutable once committed**: every
change lands as a new file at a new semver (patch for wording, minor for
additive changes, major for breaking rewrites). Prompts drift whenever the
code that renders them, the sources of truth they embed, or the sections they
reference change.

> **Currently dormant:** `prompts/` holds only its `README.md` — this game
> ships no LLM-driven behavior yet. The first candidate is a level-describer
> prompt (turning a generated level's course — its gates, ramps, skerries and
> the day's sea state — into the sort of briefing a race marshal would read,
> `prompts/level-briefing/1_0_0.md`). Until a prompt directory exists, a run
> of this skill is: confirm the diff shows no new `prompts/<name>/`
> directory, rewrite the baseline, and stop.

## Tracking mechanism

`.agents/skills/update-prompts/.last-updated` contains the git commit hash from
the last successful run. Empty means "never run" — fall back to the initial
commit.

## Discovery process

1. Read the baseline:

   ```sh
   BASELINE=$(cat .agents/skills/update-prompts/.last-updated)
   ```

2. Enumerate every prompt file and note its current version:

   ```sh
   find prompts -name '[0-9]*_[0-9]*.md' | sort
   ```

3. Diff the watched paths against the baseline:

   ```sh
   git diff --name-only "$BASELINE"..HEAD -- prompts/
   ```

   Extend this list with every file that feeds content into a prompt — e.g.
   a doc whose text is embedded in a prompt body (for a briefing prompt:
   `engine/mapgen/rules.ts`'s vocabulary and `docs/level-generator.md`), any
   module that builds the prompt's rendering context (the values substituted
   into its `{{ placeholder }}` tokens — a `Gate`'s `kind`, `seaSummary`'s
   `Hs`/`Tp`), any enum whose variants appear in a JSON schema inside the
   prompt (e.g. `Surface`, `Solid.kind`).

4. For each path in the diff, walk the mapping table and decide which prompts
   are now stale.

## Mapping table

| Source-of-truth change | Prompt(s) to audit | What to check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A source doc/module whose text is embedded in a prompt body | every prompt that embeds it | Embedded vocabulary and cross-references still match the source. |
| A new rendering-context placeholder | the prompt's `## User` section | Reference the new `{{ placeholder }}`; remove tokens the caller no longer fills. |
| A new enum / JSON-schema value in the code (`engine/mapgen/types.ts`) | prompts that describe the schema | Update the embedded JSON schema. |
| A new prompt file under `prompts/<name>/` | the code that loads it | Confirm the loader picks by name (not a pinned version) so the new file is auto-selected. |

Extend this table every time you discover a new drift path.

## Update checklist

- [ ] Read the baseline from `.last-updated`
- [ ] Run `git diff --name-only` against watched paths; bail out if nothing
      relevant changed
- [ ] For each affected prompt, add a new versioned file —
      `<major>_<minor>_<patch+1>.md` for wording fixes,
      `<major>_<minor+1>_0.md` for additive changes, `<major+1>_0_0.md` for
      breaking rewrites (committed prompt files are immutable)
- [ ] Keep the previous version in place when adding a new one (§13.5
      retention)
- [ ] Update any code caller that pins a specific prompt version
- [ ] Run `make fmt`, `make lint`, `make test`
- [ ] Write the new baseline:

      git rev-parse HEAD > .agents/skills/update-prompts/.last-updated

## Verification

1. Every `{{ placeholder }}` in a rendered prompt has a matching key in the
   caller's rendering context.
2. Every context key the caller passes is referenced by the prompt at least
   once.
3. `make test` passes.
4. `.last-updated` has been rewritten with the current `HEAD`.

## Skill self-improvement

After a run, edit this file in place:

1. **Grow the mapping table** with any new source → prompt path you discovered
   (operating data — edit it in place).
2. **Record drift signals** — if a prompt went stale through a path not
   captured above, add the path.
3. **Record recurring patterns** as lesson fragments — load the
   **`skill-reflection`** skill, which owns recording, scoping, pruning and
   promoting them (`node scripts/skill-lessons.mjs update-prompts --list`).
4. **Commit the skill edit** together with the prompt edits so the knowledge
   compounds.
